							<h4> Peer Response </h4>
							<p> Hi Thiago,

This is a clear and well-explained discussion on the growth and strategic value of agent-based systems (ABS). I agree with your points about their autonomy, adaptability, and suitability for dynamic environments, especially in finance where speed and accuracy are critical. The credit scoring example effectively illustrates how ABS can process diverse datasets in real time, adapt to changing information, and make instant lending decisions, significantly improving operational efficiency and risk management(Hussain et al., 2024). I particularly like that you highlighted their ability to contribute to global goals through local decision-making, as this decentralised approach is a key advantage in fast-paced, data-heavy industries.

A suggestion to further strengthen this discussion is to include examples from supply chain management, where ABS are increasingly used to monitor inventory, predict demand fluctuations, and autonomously adjust procurement or logistics(Alonge et al., 2021). For instance, Amazon employs agent-based models to optimise warehouse operations, ensuring stock is available where needed while minimising overstock costs. This demonstrates how ABS can bring similar adaptability and efficiency benefits beyond finance(Chen, 2024). Overall, your analysis captures why ABS are becoming a strategic asset. Including cross-industry examples can further show their versatility and reinforce the argument for their adoption.
